NETWORK 400 Group Project

Dynamic Routing Mechanism Design in Faulty Networks:
This team will simulate a mesh network where nodes and links may fail. Nodes and links may fail 
intermittently, as an input to the simulation, each node & link will have a certain probability to fail.
When such failures occur, the network must adapt & re-route to avoid the faulty link/node.

MESH NETWORKS:

- Can relay messages using either flooding technique or routing technique.
- Fixing itself using shortest path bridging.

MESH NETWORKS MESSAGE TECHNIQUES:

- flooding technique: Sending the message to each child which then sends the message to all its children.
    (can use ACK or non ACK type)
- routing technique: Is based on the multicast, unicast, ... and so on. This sounds like a form of porting 
    in which each node waits for a specific port call to then receive the message.

SOLVING PROBLEMS:

- Mesh networks don't connect dynamically and non-hierarchically
- Each node knows it's neighbor, so how would it know the shortest distance from one node to another?
